Understanding the factors that improve Business ratings on Yelp (Status Report)

Objective:
   Model a system that provides suggestions for improving ratings( to get more 3/4/5 ratings) and positive reviews of businesses that consistently get 1/2 ratings on yelp.


Tools and Environment setup 

Most of the time spent has been in setting up tools required for analysing the data.

Due to large volumes of data involved, I decided to use amazon Ec2 cluster services to parse the data.

I have successfully set up Amazon Ec2 instances.

Also, to run tests on sample data,  I installed some popular data mining tools (rapid miner, Gephi, Tableau Public 8.3) and trying to run aggregate functions on the required attributes.

I had to write python code to convert json format to csv for the data mining tools to interpret the data. 

I am currently writing parsing code to parse complex attributes (nested attributes) in the json file.

I also performed data wrangling activities for some the data files.

Next steps:

1) Parse reviews data and run sentiment analysis.
2) Extract factors for a business to get poor(1,2) and good(3,4,5) ratings ( grouping by business )
3) Run sentiment analysis.
