Understanding the factors that improve Business ratings on Yelp (Status Report)

Most of the time spent has been in setting up tools required for analysing the data.

I have successfully set up Amazon Ec2 instances until now.  Also, I installed some popular data mining tools (rapid miner, Gephi, Tableau Public 8.3) and trying to run aggregate functions on the required attributes.

I had to write python code to convert json format to csv for the data mining tools to interpret the data. I am currently writing parsing code to parse complex attributes (nested attributes) in the json file.

I also performed data wrangling activities
