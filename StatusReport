Understanding the factors that improve Business ratings on Yelp (Status Report)

Tools and Environment setup 

Most of the time spent has been in setting up tools required for analysing the data.

Due to large volumes of data involved, I decided to use amazon Ec cluster services to parse the data.

I have successfully set up Amazon Ec2 instances until now.  

Also, to run tests on sample data,  I installed some popular data mining tools (rapid miner, Gephi, Tableau Public 8.3) and trying to run aggregate functions on the required attributes.

I had to write python code to convert json format to csv for the data mining tools to interpret the data. 

I am currently writing parsing code to parse complex attributes (nested attributes) in the json file.

I also performed data wrangling activities
